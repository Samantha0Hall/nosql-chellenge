Module 12 Challenge
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Eat Safe, Love has specific questions they want you to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.
